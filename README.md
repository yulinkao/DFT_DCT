# DFT_DCT
Implementation of DFT, DCT, and 2D-DCT Transforms

* exp1: Image DFT and DCT Forward and Inverse Transformations
* exp2: Apply 2D-DCT transformation to 8x8 blocks of a selected image, keep only the coefficients from the first six diagonal lines in the top-left corner (set others to 0), and then perform an 8x8 inverse transformation.

Please run these codes with Matlab. Also, a test picture named "tridog.jpg" should be put in the same folder with the code.
